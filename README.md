# bash_env_setup.sh
Custom bash aliases and commands for enhanced Linux/Unix CLI configuration.

These scripts have three purposes:

      0. to create a customized bash framework for ultra-fast code development

      1. to allow the sysadmin to take control of the Linux/Unix terminal environment in a simple yet powerful way

      2. to provide a simplified way for sysadmins to setup new Raspian and Jetson Nano systems with all the dependencies and latest security features, as well as a wide range of other useful packages like nginx, ssh, netstat, nautilus, and vnc

These scripts setup the Linux/Unix terminal environment for:

      -- fast navigation between system directories and files

      -- automated code compilation and execution

      -- automated dependency installation

      -- local system and network interrogation

      -- simplified sw package updates, upgrades, repairs, and installations

      -- simplified remote network and traceroute evaluation

There is also lots of useful information about networking, ssh, and many other topics included in the script.

####### INSTRUCTIONS #######

In order to run this script in a given CLI:

      -- you must be in the home directory

      -- you must have runinstall.sh and zsetup installed in the home directory

      -- you must run the following command:

            . ./runinstall.sh

NOTE: Don't forget the important dot-space at the beginning of the command because this designates the current CLI as the target.
