# bash_env_setup.sh
Custom bash aliases and commands for enhanced Linux/Unix CLI configuration.

These scripts have three purposes:

1. to create a customized bash framework for ultra-fast code development

2. to allow the sysadmin to take control of the Linux/Unix terminal environment in a simple yet powerful way

3. to provide a simplified way for sysadmins to setup new Raspian and Jetson Nano systems (running almost any Linux/Unix distro) with all the dependencies and latest security features, as well as a wide range of other useful packages like nginx, ssh, netstat, nautilus, and vnc

These scripts setup the Linux/Unix terminal environment for:

-- fast navigation between system directories and files

-- automated code compilation and execution

-- automated dependency installation

-- local system and network interrogation

-- simplified sw package updates, upgrades, repairs, and installations

-- simplified remote network and traceroute evaluation

There is also lots of useful information about networking, ssh, and many other topics included in the script.

This repo will change periodically as new commands are added.
